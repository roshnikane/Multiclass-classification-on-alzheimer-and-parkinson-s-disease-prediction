# multiple disease prediction using machine learning
Parkinson’s Disease affects mobility and speech in older adults, while Alzheimer’s impairs memory and cognition. Both are hard to detect early, causing misdiagnosis. We built a CNN-based model that analyzes brain scans to classify Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or healthy cases. This deep learning approach supports early detection and timely treatment.
